A Tour of the Cyclus User Interface with IPython Notebook
=========================================================

An IPython notebook has four main areas:

* A **Run** button that runs the cell you're in
* A **Up and Down** buttons that move you up or down a cell
* A vertical blue line that shows what cell you're currently in
* A **Stop** button that stops running the cell you're in
